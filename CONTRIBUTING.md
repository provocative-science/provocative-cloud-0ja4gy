## Introduction

### Platform Vision
Provocative Cloud is a GPU rental platform that combines high-performance computing with environmental responsibility. Our platform enables AI/ML developers and data scientists to access GPU resources while contributing to carbon capture initiatives.

### Environmental Commitment
Every contribution must consider its environmental impact. Our integrated cooling system captures CO2 from server airflow, and we expect all code changes to maintain or improve our environmental efficiency.

### Security First Approach
Security is paramount in our GPU infrastructure. All contributions must adhere to our comprehensive security standards to protect our users' data and computing resources.

### Code of Conduct
We maintain a welcoming, inclusive community. All contributors must follow our Code of Conduct, which promotes respectful collaboration and technical excellence.
